    "Baseball is a team sport in which two teams alternate between offense and defense: the goal is to hit the ball with a bat and score points by running between four bases. It is a game heavily based on strategy, individual skill, and statistics, especially in the pitcher-batter matchup. It is one of the most data-driven sports, in which every action generates detailed statistics used to evaluate performance, strategies, and probabilities of success."

    "In 2003, the book ```Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game``` was published about the Oakland Athletics baseball team and its general manager Billy Beane. It describes the team's sabermetric approach to assembling a competitive baseball team on a small budget. The central premise of Moneyball is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and executives) over the past century is outdated, subjective, and often wrong, and that the statistics traditionally used to evaluate players, such as stolen bases, runs batted in, and batting average, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game. Sabermetrics and statistical analysis have shown, for example, that on-base percentage and slugging percentage are better measures of hitting. The Oakland A's began looking for players who were “undervalued by the market,” meaning they were receiving salaries lower than their ability to contribute to wins, as measured by these advanced statistics.This approach proved to be highly effective, as the Athletics achieved sustained competitive success despite operating with one of the lowest payrolls in Major League Baseball.\n",

    "In this project, we use a Bayesian inference approach to analyze metrics related to the Moneyball philosophy, both at the team and individual player level. We compare traditional statistics with advanced metrics such as OBP, SLG, and OPS, evaluating their ability to explain and predict success in terms of wins. The use of Bayesian models allows us to quantify uncertainty and update performance estimates in a manner consistent with the dynamic nature of the game."

    "Moneyball emphasizes the importance of on-base percentage (OBP) as a measure of a batter's ability to reach base, whether through hits or walks. Historically, batting average (BA) had been the dominant offensive statistic in baseball, rewarding players solely for their ability to hit safely, while ignoring walks. As a result, players with strong plate discipline were systematically undervalued.\n",

    "The Moneyball philosophy highlighted that reaching base, regardless of how it is achieved, is a fundamental mechanism for generating runs and, ultimately, winning games. In this sense, OBP represents a shift from traditional descriptive to statistics that better capture the underlying processes that determine team success. This insight motivates a formal comparison between OBP and BA in terms of their association with team-level performance outcomes. \n",

    "Baseball hitters have historically been evaluated using simple statistics, such as batting average, that capture hit frequency but fail to fully describe offensive value. With the rise of sabermetrics, greater emphasis has been placed on On-Base Percentage (OBP) and Slugging Percentage (SLG), which represent two fundamental offensive skills: the ability to reach base and the ability to generate power.\n",

As illustrated in the OBP–SLG quadrant analysis, this results in four common archetypes: Elite, Contact, Power, and Below-average hitters. Despite their widespread use in baseball discourse, it remains an open empirical question whether these categories reflect meaningful differences in offensive production.\n",
